# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an automated WhatsApp messaging system that monitors incoming messages and sends customized auto-replies to senders. The system will provide users with the ability to set up personalized automatic responses for their WhatsApp account, helping manage communication when they are unavailable or want to provide instant acknowledgments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a WhatsApp user, I want to automatically send custom replies to incoming messages, so that I can acknowledge receipt and provide information even when I'm not available to respond immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new message is received on WhatsApp THEN the system SHALL detect the incoming message within 5 seconds
2. WHEN an incoming message is detected THEN the system SHALL send a predefined custom reply to the sender
3. WHEN sending an auto-reply THEN the system SHALL use the user's configured custom message text
4. IF the sender is in the user's contacts THEN the system SHALL personalize the reply with the contact's name
5. WHEN an auto-reply is sent THEN the system SHALL log the interaction with timestamp and sender information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure different custom messages for different scenarios, so that I can provide appropriate responses based on context or time of day.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the user SHALL be able to set multiple custom message templates
2. WHEN setting up messages THEN the user SHALL be able to define default and personalized message variants
3. IF it is outside business hours THEN the system SHALL use an "out of office" message template
4. WHEN configuring messages THEN the user SHALL be able to include dynamic placeholders like sender name and current time
5. WHEN updating message templates THEN the system SHALL save changes and apply them to future auto-replies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control when auto-replies are sent, so that I can avoid sending inappropriate responses or spamming contacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the user SHALL be able to enable or disable auto-reply functionality
2. WHEN a contact sends multiple messages within 30 minutes THEN the system SHALL send only one auto-reply to avoid spam
3. IF a sender is in a blacklist THEN the system SHALL NOT send any auto-reply
4. WHEN the user is actively using WhatsApp THEN the system SHALL optionally pause auto-replies
5. WHEN setting up the system THEN the user SHALL be able to define time-based rules for when auto-replies are active

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor and manage the auto-reply system, so that I can track its performance and make adjustments as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auto-replies are sent THEN the system SHALL maintain a log of all automated responses
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the user SHALL see statistics on messages received and auto-replies sent
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue operating for other messages
4. WHEN accessing the system THEN the user SHALL be able to view recent activity and system status
5. IF the WhatsApp connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect and notify the user of connection issues
